                    <h3>Milly - Georgetown</h3>

                    <p>The rigorous college application process lost all intimidation with the help of Mr. Gutierrez. The individual attention and patience I received from Mr. G gave me the ability to turn in applications to my dream school that I was confident and completely satisfied with. Without the help of Mr. G, I doubt I would have been able to seize the opportunity to encompass the person that I am through my personal statements and application questions.</p>

                    <p>Mr. G helped me develop as a critical thinker, expanded my global perspective, and encouraged me to chase my goals. Mr. Gutierrez taught me to challenge conventional thought and develop my critical thinking. He taught me that institutions and accolades do not define me; rather I help define the organizations and institutions I chose to engage and collaborate with.</p>

                    <p>Helping me pick and choose my defining moments in high school, draw out their essence and importance, and compose a polished, clean, and focused essay, Mr. G has been invaluable in the college application journey. His ability to see me as I really am in just a few short hours was instrumental in finding my core person, a process that has helped me time and time again, even after applications were due. I owe him all my success.</p>

                <p>Thank you.  I realized how much of an impact you have/had on my life.  I thought all counselors were actively involved with their students like you, I was wrong.  I thank you for all you have done and want to tell you that I respect you as a counselor and human being for your patience, understanding, and outgoing ways.  </p>
